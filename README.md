#### In a nutshell…

-   **Manual QA review:**  0.0/105 mandatory & 0.0/31 optional
-   **Altogether:**  **0.0%**
    -   Mandatory: 0.0%
    -   Optional: 0.0%
    -   Calculation: 0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) == **0.0%**

In this project, you will finalize the previous project  [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/oiPG7fxT8IPuYTMm8gbVBw "0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap")  and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of  [0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/oiPG7fxT8IPuYTMm8gbVBw "0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap")  and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:
